# Gravitee

I started this project to make a 3D remake of one my favorite games from Kongregate:
https://www.kongregate.com/games/funkypear/gravitee.

This game will probably be renamed because I had copied the name without a permission.
Skybox graphics are also not mine, I will need to update them.
